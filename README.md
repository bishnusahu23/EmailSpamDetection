# Email Classification: Spam or Ham
## Project Overview
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to effectively classify emails into two categories: spam and ham (non-spam). Once classified, we will perform sentiment analysis on the identified emails to evaluate their emotional tone and gain deeper insights into their content.  

## Objectives
Email Classification: Develop an accurate model to classify emails as either spam or ham, enhancing email management and filtering.  

Sentiment Analysis: Conduct sentiment analysis on the classified emails to assess and interpret their emotional context, providing valuable insights for user engagement.  

## Machine Learning Techniques Employed
Text Mining: Extracting relevant information and patterns from textual data.  

TF-IDF Vectorizer: Transforming text into numerical feature vectors to improve classification accuracy.  

Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB): Implementing a robust classification algorithm suitable for large datasets and text-based data.  

VADER Sentiment Analyzer: Utilizing this tool to perform sentiment analysis on the emails, focusing on the overall emotional tone.  

## Conclusion
The implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for email classification has proven to be highly effective, with the model achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%. This exceptional performance demonstrates the model's ability to accurately distinguish between spam and ham emails, providing a reliable solution for email management.  
Overall, this project showcases the power of NLP in tackling real-world problems, paving the way for further advancements in automated email processing and analysis.
